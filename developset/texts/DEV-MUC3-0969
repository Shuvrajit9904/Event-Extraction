   MANAGUA, 20 MAR 89 -- [COMMENTARY] [TEXT] THE MURDER OF THREE
JOURNALISTS IN EL SALVADOR YESTERDAY ONCE AGAIN SHOWS THE REPRESSIVE AND
CRIMINAL NATURE OF THE SALVADORAN ARMY.

   THOSE ACTIONS AGAINST OUR PRESS COLLEAGUES ARE ONLY COMPARABLE WITH
ACTIONS CARRIED OUT BY THE ARMIES IN CHILE, PARAGUAY, AND OTHER MILITARY
DICTATORSHIPS.  THE SOMOZIST ARMY COMMITTED SIMILAR CRIMES IN NICARAGUA.  WE
JUST HAVE TO REMEMBER THE COLD WAY IN WHICH U.S.  JOURNALIST BILL STEWART
WAS KILLED WHILE COVERING THE LAST PHASE OF THE INSURRECTION IN MANAGUA'S
WESTERN NEIGHBORHOODS.

   IN EL SALVADOR, FOREIGN AND NATIONAL JOURNALISTS ARE DEMANDING A SERIOUS
INVESTIGATION FROM PRESIDENT DUARTE'S GOVERNMENT TO PUNISH THE MILITARY MEN
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CRIME.  WILL THE ARMY'S HIGH COMMAND BE WILLING TO
CONDUCT THE INVESTIGATION?  WE DOUBT IT, BASED ON ITS LACK OF WILLINGNESS TO
RECTIFY THINGS IN THE PAST REGARDING OTHER CASES, SUCH AS THE ASSASSINATION
OF MSGR ROMERO AND THE MURDER OF HERBERT ANAYA, PRESIDENT OF THE HUMAN
RIGHTS COMMISSION.  AFTER ALL, THAT IS THE WAY IN WHICH NAPOLEON DUARTE'S
CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT RESTRAINS FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION IN HIS
COUNTRY.  MORE THAN 11 JOURNALISTS HAVE BEEN KILLED BY THE SALVADORAN ARMY
SINCE 1981.  

   MEANWHILE, IN NICARAGUA, JOURNALISTS FROM INDEPENDENT MEDIA ARE CONCERNED
ABOUT 39 FORMER SOMOZIST GUARDS WHO ARE STILL IN JAIL BECAUSE OF THEIR
CRIMINAL RECORDS, TO THE POINT OF LAUNCHING JOURNALISTIC CAMPAIGNS DEMANDING
FROM THE GOVERNMENT THE RELEASE OF THE HARMLESS PIGEONS.

   WHAT WILL THEY SAY NOW ABOUT THE SALVADORAN ARMY, WHICH MURDERED THEIR
COLLEAGUES WHO WERE COMPLYING WITH THEIR DUTY TO INFORM THE PUBLIC?  WILL
THEY DEFEND THEM AS THEY DEFENDED THE SOMOZIST GUARDS?  THEY PROBABLY WILL.
THEY WILL TRY TO PLAY DOWN THE ACTION, BECAUSE THEY HAVE LOST THEIR DIGNITY,
GOOD SENSE, AND PROFESSIONAL PRIDE A LONG TIME AGO.
