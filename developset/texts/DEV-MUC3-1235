DEV-MUC3-1235 (BOEING)

   BOGOTA, 26 APR 90 (RADIO CADENA NACIONAL) -- [TEXT] A FEW MINUTES AGO AN
OFFICIAL SPOKESMAN FROM THE NATIONAL SOCIAL SECURITY FUND [CNPS] READ THE
FOLLOWING COMMUNIQUE CONFIRMING THE DEATH OF MR. PIZARRO.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [UNIDENTIFIED SPOKESMAN] THE CNPS REGRETS TO INFORM
THE PEOPLE THAT PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE CARLOS PIZARRO LEONGOMEZ WAS
ADMITTED TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM THIS MORNING, AFTER HAVING BEEN SHOT
SEVERAL TIMES IN THE HEAD AND NECK A FEW MINUTES EARLIER.  THESE SHOTS
CAUSED VERY SERIOUS NEUROLOGICAL AND CEREBRAL WOUNDS AS WELL AS GRAVE
WOUNDS TO THE FACE AND NECK.

   DESPITE THE EFFORTS OF A TEAM OF DOCTORS, INCLUDING GENERAL
SURGEONS, NEUROSURGEONS, ANESTHESISTS, OPHTHALMOLOGISTS, DOCTORS FROM
THE INTENSIVE CARE UNIT, AND OTHER STAFF MEMBERS OF THE CNPS, IT WAS
NOT POSSIBLE TO SAVE HIS LIFE AND HE DIED [7-SECOND BREAK IN
RECEPTION] [END RECORDING]

   ...GOT INTO AN ALTERCATION WITH THE M-19 LEADERS WHO WERE THERE AT
THE TIME SHOUTING SLOGANS.  THEY DID NOT ALLOW THE CNPS SPOKESMAN TO
FINISH READING THE COMMUNIQUE.

   THE AUTHORITIES HAVE AGAIN CORDONED OFF THE AREA.  THE M-19 MEMBERS
ARE PROTESTING THE MURDER OF PIZARRO LEONGOMEZ [7-SECOND BREAK IN
RECEPTION] I WOULD LIKE TO MENTION THAT THE NATIONAL POLICE, THE F-2,
AND THE ADMINISTRATIVE DEPARTAMENT OF SECURITY ARE CURRENTLY LOOKING
FOR AT LEAST TWO COLLABORATORS OF THE PAID ASSASSIN WHO MURDERED M-19
LEADER PIZARRO LEONGOMEZ.

   THE AUTHORITIES HAVE REPORTED THAT AT LEAST TWO MEN COLLABORATED
WITH THE MURDERER INSIDE THE HK-1400 PLANE THAT WAS FLYING BETWEEN
BOGOTA AND BARRANQUILLA.  THE AUTHORITIES HAVE ALSO REPORTED THAT THE
MACHINEGUN USED BY THE PAID ASSASSIN, WHO IDENTIFIED HIMSELF AS ALVARO
RODRIGUEZ, WAS HIDDEN IN THE BATHROOM.  NOW THE AUTHORITIES ARE TRYING
TO ESTABLISH IF THE WEAPON WAS PLACED THERE AT THE BUCARAMANGA
AIRPORT, WHERE THE PLANE HAD BEEN FOR THE PAST FEW HOURS, OR IF IT WAS
PLACED THERE IN BOGOTA.

   THE POLICE HAD SEARCHED THE PAID ASSASSIN TWICE BEFORE THE INCIDENT
BUT DID NOT FIND ANY WEAPONS.
