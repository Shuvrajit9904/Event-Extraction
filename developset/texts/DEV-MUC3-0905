   SAN SALVADOR, 30 NOV 89 (ACAN - EFE) -- [TEXT] THERE IS A TENSE
CALM, INTERRUPTED BY SPORADIC SHOOTING, IN THE EXCLUSIVE ESCALON
NEIGHBORHOOD OF THE SALVADORAN CAPITAL TODAY.  AT THE SAME TIME, MANY
FOREIGNERS ARE LEAVING THE NEIGHBORHOOD, WHICH WAS THE SITE OF HEAVY
FIGHTING BETWEEN THE SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES AND GUERRILLAS YESTERDAY.

   AN OFFICIAL OF THE UN OFFICE, WHICH IS LOCATED IN THE AREA OF
FIGHTING, TOLD ACAN-EFE THAT "ALL THE PERSONNEL ARE FINE AND WE ARE
NOW EVACUATING SOME EMPLOYEES AND FOREIGNERS LIVING IN THE AREA,
TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE CEASE-FIRE" THAT WAS ORDERED BY THE SALVADORAN
GUERRILLAS FOR SEVERAL HOURS.

   "WE HAVE NOT SEEN ANY GUERRILLAS.  THE SOLDIERS ARE IN THE AREA AND
ENTRANCE IS RESTRICTED.  THEY ARE ONLY PERMITTING THE EVACUATION," THE
OFFICIAL SAID OVER THE TELEPHONE.

   A SPOKESMAN OF THE ARMED FORCES PRESS COMMITTEE (COPREFA) SAID THIS
MORNING THAT THE ELITE COUNTERINSURGENCY BELLOSO AND ATLACATL
BATTALIONS AND TROOPS WITH ARTILLERY ARE CARRYING OUT A SPECIAL
OPERATION IN ESCALON TO DISLODGE THE REBELS.  THE SPOKESMAN SAID THE
OPERATION WILL INCLUDE ALL OF NORTHERN SAN SALVADOR.  HOWEVER, HE SAID
HE COULD NOT PROVIDE FURTHER INFORMATION BECAUSE "WE ARE STILL
COMPILING INFORMATION."

   THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN) ON 29 NOVEMBER
RESUMED ITS ATTACKS IN SAN SALVADOR, ESPECIALLY IN THE UPPER CLASS
NEIGHBORHOODS OF ESCALON, SAN BENITO, AND MAQUILISHUAT AND THE MIDDLE
CLASS NEIGHBORHOODS OF JARDIN GUADALUPE, LA CIMA, AND LOMAS DE SAN
FRANCISCO.

   AFTER SEVERAL HOURS OF FIGHTING IN THE STREETS OF THE
NEIGHBORHOODS, THE ARMY SAID IT HAD THE SITUATION UNDER CONTROL.
HOWEVER, IT ADMITTED THAT THE REBELS HAD ENTRENCHED THEMSELVES IN
ESCALON AND HAD SEIZED "THE RESIDENTS AS HOSTAGES."

   THE GUERRILLAS ANNOUNCED LAST NIGHT THAT FROM 0600 TO 1200 (1200 -
1800 GMT) TODAY, 30 NOVEMBER, THEY "WILL UNDERTAKE THE EVACUATION OF
FOREIGN PERSONNEL" IN THE ESCALON AND SAN BENITO NEIGHBORHOODS IN
NORTHERN SAN SALVADOR.  THE FMLN SAID THE MEASURE, WHICH IS BEING
HEEDED BY THE FOREIGNERS LIVING IN THOSE AREAS, IS TO GUARANTEE THE
LIVES OF THE RESIDENTS OF ESCALON.

   VARIOUS SOURCES SAID THE REBELS HAVE LEFT ESCALON, BUT THIS
INFORMATION HAS YET TO BE CONFIRMED.
