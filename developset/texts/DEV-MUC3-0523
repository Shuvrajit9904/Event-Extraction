   NO CITY (COLOMBIA), 26 SEP 89 -- [TEXT] [CONTINUED] ACCORDING TO
THE PACT SIGNED TODAY, A BILATERAL COMMISSION THAT WILL BE CREATED
SOON WILL DISCUSS THE MANNER IN WHICH THE GUERRILLA GROUP WILL BE
DEMOBILIZED.

   M-19 COMMANDER CARLOS PIZARRO SAID TODAY THAT THE ORGANIZATION,
WHICH HAS A LITTLE MORE THAN 600 MEMBERS, WILL NOT TURN IN ITS WEAPONS
TO THE ARMY, BUT TO AN INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION, POSSIBLY THE RED
CROSS.

   HOWEVER, WHILE THE M-19 IS CALLING FOR A DIALOGUE WITH THE DRUG
TRAFFICKERS, INTELLIGENCE SERVICES HAVE ANNOUNCED THAT GONZALO
RODRIGUEZ GACHA, ALIAS "EL MEJICANO," HAS BEEN SURROUNDED AND WILL
SOON BE CAPTURED.

   A SPOKESMAN FOR THE ADMINISTRATIVE SECURITY DEPARTMENT, THE
COLOMBIAN INTELLIGENCE ORGANIZATION, TOLD REUTER: "WE BELIEVE THAT
IMPORTANT ARRESTS WILL BE MADE IN THE NEXT FEW DAYS, ALTHOUGH WE DO
NOT KNOW IF WE WILL CATCH RODRIGUEZ GACHA."

   RODRIGUEZ GACHA AND PABLO ESCOBAR ARE CONSIDERED TO BE THE HEADS OF
THE FEARSOME MEDELLIN CARTEL, AN ORGANIZATION OF DRUG TRAFFICKERS
THAT, ALONG WITH ITS TWIN ORGANIZATION IN CALI, IS ACCUSED OF
SUPPLYING 80 PERCENT OF THE COCAINE THAT IS CONSUMED IN THE UNITED
STATES.

   THE COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT HAS OFFERED A REWARD OF 100 MILLION PESOS
($250,000) TO ANY CITIZEN WHO PROVIDES INFORMATION ON THE WHEREABOUTS
OF THE TWO MOST WANTED MEN IN COLOMBIA.

   YESTERDAY, A JUDGE ISSUED A WARRANT FOR THE ARREST OF FREDDY
RODRIGUEZ CELADES, SON OF "EL MEJICANO," FOR THE ILLEGAL POSSESSION OF
WEAPONS.

   IN RECENT STATEMENTS TO THE PRESS, GENERAL MIGUEL GOMEZ PADILLA,
CHIEF OF THE NATIONAL POLICE, SAID THAT BOTH DRUG TRAFFICKERS ARE IN
COLOMBIAN TERRITORY, THUS DENYING REPORTS THAT THEY HAD REPORTEDLY
MOVED THEIR BASES OF OPERATION TO PANAMA OR BRAZIL.

   FINALLY, IN CARTAGENA DE INDIAS, A TOURIST CENTER ON THE CARIBBEAN
COAST, A POWERFUL BOMB EXPLODED IN A HOTEL, KILLING TWO PEOPLE.

   THE ATTACK WAS ATTRIBUTED TO THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS, WITHIN THE
FRAMEWORK OF AN ESCALATION OF VIOLENCE IN WHICH OVER 70 BOMBS HAVE
EXPLODED IN A LITTLE OVER 1 MONTH.
