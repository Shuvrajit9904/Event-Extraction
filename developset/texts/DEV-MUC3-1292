DEV-MUC3-1292 (BOEING)

   GUATEMALA CITY, 19 MAY 90 (DPA) -- [TEXT] THE BUS STRIKE IN
GUATEMALA CITY CONTINUED FOR THE FOURTH DAY TODAY.  LAST NIGHT, THERE
WERE NEW DISTURBANCES AND TERRORIST BOMBS WERE SET OFF.

   ALTHOUGH THE SITUATION HAS CAUSED GREAT DISCONTENT AMONG THE 1.2
MILLION PEOPLE OF THE CAPITAL, THE GOVERNMENT HAS FOR THE TIME BEING
REJECTED THE MUNICIPALITY'S REQUEST TO PLACE THE BUS SERVICES UNDER
MILITARY CONTROL.

   THE BUS OWNERS ARE ASKING FOR A 100-PERCENT INCREASE IN THE 20
CENTAVO ($.05) FARE, ARGUING THAT INFLATION HAS INCREASED THE PRICE OF
GASOLINE AND THE BUS MAINTENANCE COSTS.  HOWEVER, THE MUNICIPALITY HAS
NOT AUTHORIZED THE INCREASE, FEARING A GENERALIZED PROTEST BY BUS
PASSENGERS.
