   SAN SALVADOR, 13 JAN 90 (AFP) -- [TEXT] THE SALVADORAN OPPOSITION
NATIONAL REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT (MNR) TODAY DEMANDED THAT GUATEMALAN
PRESIDENT VINICIO CEREZO "THOROUGHLY" INVESTIGATE THE ASSASSINATION OF MNR
LEADER HECTOR OQUELI AND OF GUATEMALAN ATTORNEY GILDA FLORES.

   DURING A NEWS CONFERENCE, THE MNR EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE CONDEMNED THE
"ABOMINABLE" CRIME PERPETRATED ON 12 JANUARY IN GUATEMALA BY ARMED MEN
WEARING CIVILIAN CLOTHES.  THE MNR ALSO DEMANDED THAT THE SALVADORAN
GOVERNMENT GUARANTEE THE SECURITY OF MNR SECRETARY GENERAL GUILLERMO UNGO,
WHO WILL ARRIVE IN EL SALVADOR WITHIN THE NEXT FEW HOURS TO ATTEND OQUELI'S
FUNERAL, WHICH IS SCHEDULED FOR 15 JANUARY.

   OQUELI, 45, AND GILDA FLORES, A MEMBER OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST PARTY
(PSD) OF GUATEMALA, WERE KIDNAPPED WHILE THEY WERE ON THEIR WAY TO LA AURORA
AIRPORT IN GUATEMALA CITY.  THEIR BODIES WERE FOUND LATER AT A PLACE NEAR
THE SALVADORAN BORDER.

   "THE PEOPLE RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS UNJUSTIFIABLE ASSASSINATION ARE THE
ETERNAL ENEMIES OF LIBERTY, PEACE, AND DEMOCRACY," THE MNR STATES.  THE MNR,
ALONG WITH THE SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC PARTY AND THE SOCIAL CHRISTIAN PEOPLE'S
MOVEMENT [MPSC], MAKE UP THE DEMOCRATIC CONVERGENCE COALITION.

   THE MPSC ALSO ISSUED A COMMUNIQUE DEPLORING THE ASSASSINATION OF OQUELI
AND URGING THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO CONDEMN THIS ACTION.
