   LA PAZ, 26 MAY 89 (PRESENCIA) -- [EXCERPTS] INTERIOR MINISTER
EDUARDO PEREZ BELTRAN HAS BLAMED THE MURDER OF TWO U.S. MORMON
MISSIONARIES ON NARCOTERRORISTS, WHO WANT TO GIVE IT A POLITICAL
CONNOTATION.  "DRUG TRAFFICKERS MIGHT BE INVOLVED IN THIS CRIME, AND
THEY WANT TO GIVE IT POLITICAL CONNOTATIONS," PEREZ SAID.

   PEREZ SAID THAT THE MRUDER OF THE TWO MISSIONARIES MIGHT BE A "COPYCAT
MURDER" DONE WITH THE INTENTION OF BLAMING THE "ZARATE WILKA GROUP WITH
HAVING DONE IT."  HE ADDED THAT THE GROUP IS NAMED AFTER A PEASANT LEADER
WHO LIVED EARLY THIS CENTURY.  THE PEASANT HAD NO POLITICAL AFFILIATION
WHATSOEVER. THIS IS WHY WE CAN NOT SAY WITH ABSOLUTE CERTAINTY THAT
GUERRILLA GROUPS ARE OPERATING IN THE COUNTRY.

   THE FAL-ZARATE WILKA GROUP, WHICH CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS CRIME,
LEFT A HANDWRITTEN MESSAGE TO THE EFFECT THAT THEIR WAR IS TO KILL "THE
YANKEE INVADERS WHO COME HERE TO MASSACRE OUR PEASANT BROTHERS."

   REFERRING TO THE MESSAGE LEFT AT THE SCENE, THE INTERIOR MINISTER SAID
THAT AN INITIAL ANALYSIS OF THE MESSAGE REVEALS THAT IT WAS WRITTEN IN
LANGUAGUE NOT COMMONLY USED BY A LEFTIST POLITICAL ORGANIZATION.  THE
MESSAGE IS VAGUE WHEN IT REFERS TO BOTH NATIONAL SOVEREIGNTY AND THE
EXPLOITATION OF PEASANTS.  THIS IS A CRIME IN WHICH DRUG TRAFFICKERS MIGHT
BE INVOLVED AND TO WHICH THEY WANT TO ATTACH A POLITICAL CONNOTATION," PEREZ
SAID.

   PEREZ ADDED THAT IN RECENT DAYS "THERE HAVE BEEN RUMORS THAT MEMBERS OF
THE U.S. ARMED FORCES HAVE COME TO BOLIVIA WITH PLANS TO FIGHT DRUG
TRAFFICKING.  WE HAVE TO REJECT THOSE RUMORS."

   HE SAID THAT THIS CRIME IS IN NO WAY LINKED TO THE PRESENCE OF "SHINING
PATH" TERRORISTS IN BOLIVIA.  HE SAID: "IF THIS TERRORIST GROUP IS OPERATING
IN BOLIVIA, IT SHOULD HAVE CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS CRIME, LIKE THE
NATIONAL LIBERATION ARMY (ELN) DID IN THE 1960'S WHEN THEY REVEALED THAT
THEY CARRIED OUT TERRORIST ACTIVITIES ABROAD."

   PEREZ STATED THAT MURDER OF THE U.S. MORMON MISSIONARIES SHOULD BE
SERIUSLY ANALYZED SO THAT A RELIABLE REPORT IS RELEASED.
