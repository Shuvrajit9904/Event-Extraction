   BOGOTA, 21 AUG 89 (DPA) -- [TEXT] EDUARDO MARTINEZ ROMERO, THE ALLEGED
"COMPTROLLER" OF THE MEDELLIN CARTEL, WAS CAPTURED BY COLOMBIAN AUTHORITIES
TODAY DURING THE RAID ON A FARM IN THE NORTHERN PART OF THE COUNTRY, IT WAS
REPORTED IN BOGOTA.

   IT WAS LEARNED THAT THE ARREST OF MARTINEZ ROMERO, THE MOST IMPORTANT ONE
SINCE THE ARMY AND POLICE LAUNCHED AN OFFENSIVE AGAINST THE DRUG TRAFFICKING
MAFIA LAST SATURDAY, OCCURRED ON A FARM NEAR TOLU MUNICIPALITY IN SUCRE
DEPARTMENT.

   ABOUT 24 PEOPLE WERE ALSO ARRESTED ALONG WITH THE MEDELLIN CARTEL
MEMBER.  THE CARTEL IS THE LARGEST WORLD COCAINE TRAFFICKING ORGANIZATION,
WHICH STAGED A SERIES OF VIOLENT ACTIONS LAST WEEK.

   IN FACT, MERCENARIES OF THAT CRIMINAL ORGANIZATION ASSASSINATED IN LESS
THAN 48 HOURS, MAGISTRATE CARLOS VALENCIA GARCIA, ANTIOQUIA POLICE COMMANDER
COLONEL WALDEMAR FRANKLIN QUINTERO, AND SENATOR AND PRESIDENTIAL HOPEFUL
LUIS CARLOS GALAN, WHO ACCORDING TO THE POLLS, WAS THE FAVORITE TO SUCCEED
VIRGILIO BARCO VARGAS AS PRESIDENT.

   MARTINEZ ROMERO, ONE OF THE DRUG TRAFFICKERS MOST WANTED BY THE U.S. DRUG
ENFORCEMENT ADMINISTRATION (DEA), HAD MANAGED TO EVADE A PLAN TO CAPTURE HIM
IN PANAMA CITY LAST 29 MARCH.

   UNOFFICIAL REPORTS IN BOGOTA INDICATE THAT THE WELL-KNOWN MAFIA MEMBER
COULD BE THE FIRST TO BE EXTRADITED TO THE UNITED STATES, IN KEEPING WITH
THE COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT'S NEW PROVISIONS ADOPTED IN VIEW OF THE WAVE OF
VIOLENCE.  THESE PROVISIONS AUTHORIZE THE EXTRADITION OF DRUG TRAFFICKERS TO
OTHER COUNTRIES WITHOUT HAVING TO GO THROUGH THE JUSTICE TRIBUNALS.

   ACCORDING TO OFFICIAL REPORTS, MORE THAN 11,000 PEOPLE RELATED TO THE
MAFIA HAVE BEEN ARRESTED IN THE INTENSE OPERATIONS CARRIED OUT BY THE
COLOMBIAN ARMY AND POLICE, IN THE LARGEST OFFENSIVE EVER LAUNCHED BY
COLOMBIAN AUTHORITIES AGAINST THE DRUG TRAFFICKING BANDS.

   THE ACTIONS ARE BEING CARRIED OUT ESPECIALLY IN THE DEPARTMENTS OF
ANTIOQUIA, CUNDINAMARCA, AND VALLE DEL CAUCA, WHERE SO-CALLED ELITE PATROLS
HAVE TAKEN OVER EXTENSIVE AND SWANK PROPERTIES OWNED BY PABLO ESCOBAR
GAVIRIA AND GONZALO RODRIGUEZ GACHA, THE "DRUG LORDS" OF THE MEDELLIN CARTEL.

   REPORTS TODAY INDICATE THAT ONE OF THE PRIVATE HOMES BELONGING TO
RODRIGUEZ GACHA, ALIAS "THE MEXICAN," WAS RAIDED IN BOGOTA.
