   SAN JOSE (COSTA RICA), 15 JAN 90 (DPA) -- [TEXT] COSTA RICAN PRESIDENT
OSCAR ARIAS TODAY URGED GUATEMALA PRESIDENT VINICIO CEREZO TO FOLLOW THE
EXAMPLE OF SALVADORAN PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI AND ORDER AN "EXHAUSTIVE
INVESTIGATION INTO THE MURDER OF SALVADORAN SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC LEADER HECTOR
OQUELI COLINDRES IN GUATEMALA 2 DAYS AGO.

   ARIAS SAID: "I HOPE PRESIDENT CEREZO WILL DUPLICATE THE ACTIONS
TAKEN BY HIS COUNTERPART ALFREDO CRISTIANI IN THE CASE OF THE JESUITS
WHO WERE SAVAGELY KILLED 2 MONTHS AGO IN EL SALVADOR."

   THE COSTA RICAN PRESIDENT HARSHLY CRITICIZED "HECTOR OQUELI'S
MURDERERS.  THIS IS A HORRIBLE CRIME," HE SAID.

   THE COSTA RICAN PRESIDENT IS VERY MOVED BY THE MURDER OF OQUELI,
BECAUSE THEY STUDIED TOGETHER AT THE UNIVERSITY OF ESSEX, GREAT
BRITAIN, 22 YEARS AGO, WHEN ARIAS OBTAINED HIS DOCTORATE.

   "HE WAS A GREAT FRIEND AND COMRADE," ARIAS SAID, RECALLING THE
DEEDS OF THE MURDERED SALVADORAN POLITICIAN, WHO VISITED COSTA RICA
SEVERAL TIMES TO PARTICIPATE IN LECTURES, SEMINARS, AND DISCUSSIONS.
