   MANAGUA (NICARAGUA), 12 DEC 89 (ACAN-EFE) -- [TEXT] NICARAGUAN
PRESIDENT DANIEL ORTEGA HAS REPORTED THAT THE SALVADORAN ARMY IS
BOMBING THE AREA SURROUNDING A VOLCANO NEAR THE SALVADORAN CAPITAL
TONIGHT, "THREATENING THE LIVES AND SECURITY OF SALVADORANS."

   IN A RADIO AND TELEVISION ADDRESS TO NICARAGUANS TO EXPLAIN THE
SCOPE OF THE AGREEMENTS SIGNED ON 12 DECEMBER IN COSTA RICA -- WHERE
THE SIXTH CENTRAL AMERICAN SUMMIT WAS HELD -- ORTEGA POINTED OUT THAT
THESE BOMBINGS "ARE AGAINST THE AGREEMENTS" WHICH WERE RECENTLY
SIGNED.

   "THE BOMBS THE SALVADORAN ARMY IS LAUNCHING DO NOT HELP AT ALL IN
COMPLYING WITH THE AGREEMENTS WE SIGNED ON 12 DECEMBER IN COSTA RICA,"
PRESIDENT ORTEGA, WHO SPOKE CALMLY, WARNED.  ORTEGA APPEALED TO THE
SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT TO CEASE THE BOMBINGS.

   THE NICARAGUAN PRESIDENT INSISTED ON THE "GREAT RESPONSIBILITY" OF
THE U.S. GOVERNMENT IN THE FULFILLMENT OF THE AGREEMENTS, PARTICULARLY
WITH REGARD TO THE POINTS THAT DEAL WITH THE DEMOBILIZATION OF THE
"CONTRAS" STATIONED IN HONDURAS.

   ORTEGA RECALLED THAT THE UNITED STATES FINANCES THE "CONTRAS" AND
THEREFORE WASHINGTON HAS IN ITS HANDS [THE POSSIBILITY] OF
"GIVING SOME TRANQUILITY TO THE NICARAGUAN PEOPLE."

   "THIS IS NOW A DEMAND OF THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PEOPLES, WHICH WAS
RATIFIED AT THE (COSTA RICA) MEETING," ORTEGA ADDED.

   ORTEGA RECALLED THAT THE DEADLINE TO DEMOBILIZE THE REBELS ENDED ON
5 DECEMBER AND THAT THE U.S. GOVERNMENT'S ATTITUDE WAS TO OPPOSE THE
DISBANDING OF THE "CONTRAS."

   ORTEGA STATED: "THUS, I BELIEVE IT IS NECESSARY THAT THE U.S.
GOVERNMENT RESPECT THE AGREEMENTS AND STOP DISRESPECTING THE RESOLVE
OF THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS AND PEOPLES WHO WANT PEACE."

   ORTEGA TRUSTS THAT WITH THE UN SUPPORT THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY
WILL MAKE EFFORTS TO PROMOTE THE DEMOBILIZATION OF APPROXIMATELY
12,000 CONTRAS STATIONED IN HONDURAS, AS WELL AS THE DIALOGUE BETWEEN
THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT AND THE GUERRILLA MOVEMENT TO SEEK A
SOLUTION TO AN OVER 10-YEAR-LONG WAR.

   ORTEGA ADMITTED THAT HE GETS WORRIED EVERY TIME HE ATTENDS A
SUMMIT, BECAUSE THESE MEETINGS "ARE HELD UNDER U.S. PRESSURE," BUT
FINALLY "WE REACHED AGREEMENTS THAT STRENGTHEN THE PEACE PROCESS."

   ACCORDING TO ORTEGA, THE PEACE PLANS SIGNED BY THE AREA PRESIDENTS
"HAVE HAD A GOOD EFFECT IN NICARAGUA," BUT HE WARNED THAT HE COULD NOT
SAY THE SAME FOR EL SALVADOR, "WITH WHICH WE CANNOT BE PLEASED YET."
