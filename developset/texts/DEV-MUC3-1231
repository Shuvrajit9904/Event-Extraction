DEV-MUC3-1231 (BOEING)

   SAN SALVADOR, 25 APR 90 (CANAL DOCE) -- [COMMUNIQUE] [COLONEL
SIGIFREDO OCHOA PEREZ] [TEXT] 1. THE ATTITUDE OF CERTAIN BAD ARMED
FORCES MEMBERS SHOULD NOT BE USED TO CREATE A NEGATIVE IMAGE OF THE
ARMED FORCES IN GENERAL.  QUITE THE CONTRARY, IT IS APPROPRIATE TO
PURGE THE RANKS AND GET RID OF THOSE BAD MEMBERS, SO THAT THEY DO NOT
CONTINUE TO HARM THE REMAINING MEMBERS.

   2.  THIS PUBLIC STATEMENT ABOUT THE NEED FOR A PURGE IS SIMPLY THE
REPLY TO A HISTORICAL REQUIREMENT, BECAUSE WHOEVER REPORTS THE ISSUE
DOES NOT CAUSE THE DAMAGE.

   3. IN REFERENCE TO THOSE WHO CARRIED OUT THE ORDER TO ASSASSINATE
THE JESUITS, THEY WERE ACTUALLY DOING THAT -- CARRYING OUT ORDERS.  I
HAVE ONLY SAID IN PUBLIC WHAT THE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN SAYING AND
EXPRESSING IN A LOW VOICE.

   4.  THEREFORE, A NATIONAL COMMENTARY DOES NOT ENDANGER THE COUNTRY
OR THE ARMED FORCES.  THOSE WHO DECIDED TO ADOPT A DECISION, WHOSE
SUBSEQUENT CONSEQUENCES THEY SHOULD HAVE ASSESSED, ARE THE ONES WHO
ENDANGERED THE U.S. MILITARY AID AND -- IN THE PROCESS -- WITTINGLY OR
UNWITTINGLY PLAYED INTO THE FMLN'S [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL
LIBERATION FRONT] HANDS.

   5.  WE SUPPOSE THAT THERE IS INFORMATION ON THE ISSUE AND THAT IT
IS EXCLUSIVELY IN THE HANDS OF CERTAIN GROUPS WHICH, FOR ONE REASON OR
ANOTHER, HAVE FAILED TO TURN IT OVER TO THE APPROPRIATE PERSONS.

   6.  JUST AS THE GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC AND A VAST MAJORITY OF
THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE EXPECTED, A FULL INVESTIGATION AND SOLUTION OF
THIS CRIME WHICH SHOOK THE WORLD, ALL GOOD SALVADORANS TRUST THAT
JUSTICE WILL PREVAIL AND THAT THOSE WHO VIOLATED THE LAW WILL ANSWER
FOR THE CRIME THEY HAVE PERPETRATED.
