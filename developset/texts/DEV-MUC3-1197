DEV-MUC3-1197 (SYNCHRONETICS)

   BOGOTA, 29 MAR 90 (EFE) -- [TEXT] THE REFORMIST SECTOR OF THE LEFTIST
PATRIOTIC UNION (UP) TODAY RESIGNED FROM THE PARTY'S NATIONAL COORDINATING
BOARD, CREATING AN UNPRECEDENTED CRISIS IN ITS FIVE YEARS OF POLITICAL LIFE.

   DURING THE SECOND DAY OF ITS PLENUM, TWELVE OF ITS 20 MEMBERS,
INCLUDING UP PRESIDENT DIEGO MONTANA CUELLAR, RESIGNED FROM THE
NATIONAL COORDINATING BOARD, WHICH ALSO INCLUDES ACTIVISTS OF THE
COMMUNIST PARTY OF COLOMBIA (PCC).

   ACCORDING TO SOURCES CLOSE TO THE UP, THE REFORMIST FACTION
RESIGNED FROM THE COORDINATING BOARD BECAUSE IT BELIEVES THAT WHAT IS
NEEDED IN COLOMBIA IS A BROAD SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC MOVEMENT, SUCH AS THAT
ADVOCATED BY UP PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE BERNARDO JARAMILLO OSSA, WHO
WAS ASSASSINATED ON 22 MARCH.

   THE LEFTIST SOURCES CONSULTED BY EFE INDICATED TODAY THAT THE
POSSIBILITY OF PARTICIPATING IN THE 27 MAY PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS, AT
LEAST WITH A JOINT UP AND PCC CANDIDATE, IS GROWING MORE DISTANT.

   WHILE THE UP'S REFORMIST FACTION REJECTS THE ARMED PATH AS A MEANS
TO ACHIEVE POWER, THE SECTOR KNOWN AS THE RADICALS, IN OTHER WORDS,
THE EIGHT MEMBERS WHO DID NOT RESIGN FROM THE COORDINATING BOARD,
AGREE ON USING DIFFERENT FORMS OF STRUGGLE, INCLUDING GUERRILLA
STRUGGLE.

   THE EIGHT MEMBERS WHO DID NOT RESIGN BELONG TO THE PCC.

   IN ADDITION TO MONTANA, LEADERS ANGELINO GARZON, GUILLERMO
BANGUERO, ALBERTO ROJAS PUYO, JULIO SANTANA, AND LUIS EMIRO VALENCIA
WERE AMONG THOSE WHO RESIGNED.

   AT THE SAME TIME, 12 MEMBERS OF THE NATIONAL COMMITTEE, ANOTHER
SECTION OF THE PARTY, ALSO RESIGNED.  THEY ARE ALSO FROM THE REFORMIST
FACTION.

   THE FRICTION WITH THE REFORMISTS OR PERESTROYKA SUPPORTERS BEGAN ON
28 MARCH, THE FIRST DAY OF SESSIONS OF THE PLENUM, WHEN ANGELINO
GARZON CHARGED THAT THE PCC HAD INTERCEPTED JARAMILLO OSSA'S LETTERS.

   ANOTHER REASON FOR THE DIVISION WITHIN THE COLOMBIAN LEFT WAS THE
NOT VERY FAVORABLE RESULTS IN THE 11 MARCH LEGISLATIVE AND MUNICIPAL
ELECTIONS, WHEN THE UP AND THE PCC LOST SEVERAL SEATS IN THE COLOMBIAN
CONGRESS.

   UP TO 22 MARCH, THE DAY WHEN JARAMILLO WAS ASSASSINATED, HE WAS THE
SINGLE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE OF THE UP AND THE PCC, BUT AFTER HIS
DEATH, BOTH PARTIES AGREED TO HOLD A PLENUM TO DECIDE WHETHER THEY
WILL PARTICIPATE IN THE ELECTIONS.
