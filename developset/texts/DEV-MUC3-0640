   CLANDESTINE, 4 NOV 89 (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [INTERVIEW WITH
FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT, FMLN, COMMANDER SALVADOR
SANCHEZ, ALIAS COMMANDER LEONEL GONZALEZ, MEMBER OF THE FMLN GENERAL
COMMAND, BY UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER] [TEXT] [REPORTER] COMMANDER LEONEL
GONZALEZ, ON FRIDAY NIGHT MR ALFREDO CRISTIANI ANNOUNCED SOME MEASURES
WHICH THE GOVERNMENT WILL ADOPT IN CONNECTION WITH FENASTRAS
[SALVADORAN WORKERS NATIONAL UNION FEDERATION] AND THE DIALOGUE.  THE
FMLN ANNOUNCED IT HAD SUSPENDED ITS TRIP TO CARACAS, BUT CRISTIANI
SAID THAT THE GOVERNMENT COMMISSION WILL GO TO CARACAS REGARDLESS OF
OUR DECISION.  WHAT IS YOUR OPINION ON THE GOVERNMENT'S DECISION?

   [GONZALEZ] IN MY OPINION, TWO POSITIONS ON THE DIALOGUE AND THE
NEGOTIATIONS PROCESS WERE MADE EVIDENT IN SAN JOSE.  THE GOVERNMENT OF
ALFREDO CRISTIANI AND THE ARMED FORCES HIGH COMMAND VIEW THE DIALOGUE
AS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR TALKING, BUYING TIME, AND BUILDING A GOOD IMAGE
FOR THEMSELVES.  ON THE OTHER HAND, THE FMLN IS WORKING FOR A REAL
NEGOTIATIONS PROCESS.  THE FMLN HAS OPENED A BROADER DEBATE, A DEBATE
THAT INCLUDES DISCUSSIONS WITH AND THE PARTICIPATION OF POLITICAL
PARTIES, THE SOCIAL FORCES, THE CHURCH, ALL THE SECTORS. WE HAVE
INITIATED A NATIONAL DIALOGUE.  AS WE SEE IT, THE GOAL IS PART OF A
WHOLE, IT IS NOT EVERYTHING.  THE ENTIRE PROCESS OF ALLOWING THE
PARTICIPATION OF THE SOCIAL FORCES IS IMPORTANT ALSO.

   IN RECENT DAYS WE HAVE SEEN ACTIONS UNPRECEDENTED IN THE HISTORY OF
EL SALVADOR.  THERE WAS THE ATTACK ON WORKERS IN WHICH 10 WORKERS DIED
AND 31 WERE INJURED.  THE FMLN CANNOT IGNORE THIS FACT.  THIS IS PART
OF THE PROCESS.  WE HAVE SAID THAT WE ARE GOING TO ESTABLISH CONTACT
WITH OBSERVERS AND MEDIATORS TO ANALYZE THE SITUATION, AND WE WILL
DISCUSS THIS PROCESS WITH THE POLITICAL PARTIES AND THE SOCIAL FORCES.
WHAT WE WANT IS TO CONSOLIDATE THE NEGOTIATIONS PROCESS.  WE ARE NOT
TRYING TO ENHANCE OUR IMAGE; OUR PEOPLE KNOW WHO IS TELLING THE TRUTH.

   IN SAN JOSE WE MADE A SOLUTION PROPOSAL THAT ENVISAGES DEMOCRACY,
HUMAN RIGHTS, AND A PROCESS TO FIND A WAY OUT OF THE SALVADORAN
CONFLICT.  ON MONDAY AND WEDNESDAY OF NEXT WEEK WE ARE GOING TO MEET
IN WASHINGTON WITH OAS AND UN REPRESENTATIVES.  ALSO ON MONDAY IN SAN
JOSE, COSTA RICA, WE COULD BE IN CONTACT WITH THE COSTA RICAN
GOVERNMENT TO ANALYZE THE SITUATION.

   WE WILL ANALYZE DEVELOPMENTS TO DETERMINE THE POSITION OF THE
CRISTIANI GOVERNMENT.  IF ACTIONS BY THE CRISTIANI GOVERNMENT CLOSE
THE POSSIBILITIES OF CARACAS, THEN WE WILL ADOPT MEASURES.  WHAT WE
HAVE DONE IS TO ANNOUNCE A SUSPENSION TO CREATE CONDITIONS FOR MAKING
PROGRESS TOWARD REAL NEGOTIATIONS, AS THE SAN JOSE AGREEMENTS
ESTABLISH.

   [REPORTER] THEN WHY IS THE GOVERNMENT GOING TO CARACAS, COMMANDER?

   [GONZALEZ] I BELIEVE THAT THE ANNOUNCEMENT ON THE GOVERNMENT
DELEGATION GOING TO CARACAS IS AIMED AT ENHANCING THE GOVERNMENT'S
 IMAGE, AT CREATING A SMOKE SCREEN AROUND THE MASSACRE COMMITTED
AGAINST THE POPULAR MOVEMENT.

   [REPORTER] NOW THAT YOU MENTION THE FENASTRAS MASSACRE, WHAT DO YOU
THINK ABOUT THE CREATION OF A COMMISSION TO INVESTIGATE THIS CASE THAT
CRISTIANI HAS ANNOUNCED?

   [GONZALEZ] ONE OF THE POINTS OF OUR SAN JOSE PROPOSAL CALLS FOR
CHANGING THE SALVADORAN LEGAL SYSTEM BECAUSE IT IS VITIATED AND IS IN
THE HANDS OF ONE SINGLE PARTY.  SO, IN THIS FRAMEWORK, CONDUCTING AN
INVESTIGATION IS LIKE PUTTING THE CASE INSIDE A FORGOTTEN DRAWER.
THIS IS WHAT HAPPENED TO THE MONSIGNOR ROMERO CASE, THE CASE OF THE
REVOLUTIONARY DEMOCRATIC FRONT LEADERS, AND THE CASES OF THOUSANDS OF
WORKERS WHO HAVE BEEN MURDERED AND WHOSE CASES HAVE BEEN FORGOTTEN.
THE PURPOSE OF THIS COMMISSION IS TO CREATE A SMOKE SCREEN AROUND THE
GRAVE HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS BEING COMMITTED BY THE CRISTIANI
GOVERNMENT.  WE BELIEVE THAT THE PERSONS WHO HAVE BEEN INVITED TO FORM
PART OF THIS COMMISSION SHOULD NOT LEND THEMSELVES TO PLAYING A PART
IN THE EFFORT TO HIDE WHAT IS REALLY BEHIND ALL THIS.  WHAT THE
CRISTIANI GOVERNMENT WANTS IS TO DIVERT AWAY FROM EMILIO PONCE ALL THE
ACCUSATIONS AND CHARGES, AND PONCE IS THE ONE WHO IS DIRECTLY INVOLVED
IN THIS KIND OF ATTACK.  THE STATE POLICY OF THE CRISTIANI GOVERNMENT
IS REPRESSION, AND THIS STATE POLICY IS BEING IMPLEMENTED BY THE
CRISTIANI GOVERNMENT, CRISTIANI, AND THE HIGH COMMAND, AND THEY ARE
DOING IT THROUGH THE REPRESSIVE BODIES, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THEY
FUNCTION AS CIVILIANS, AS DEATH SQUADS, OR IN UNIFORM.  [CONTINUED]
