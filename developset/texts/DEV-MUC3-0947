   CARACAS (VENEZUELA), 7 DEC 89 (DPA) -- [TEXT] VENEZUELAN PRESIDENT CARLOS
ANDRES PEREZ PREDICTED A SERIOUS CRISIS ON THE CONTINENT IF A SOLUTION FOR
THE CENTRAL AMERICAN CONFLICT IS NOT FOUND.  HE APPEALED TO "THE FOREIGN
POWERS" TO HALT THEIR INTERVENTION IN THE SUBREGION.

   IN A NEWS CONFERENCE BROADCAST OVER TELEVISION FOR ALL THE COUNTRY,
PEREZ TODAY PREDICTED THAT THE COMING CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS
SUMMIT TO BE HELD IN SAN JOSE WILL FAIL IF WHAT HE DESCRIBED AS
"FOREIGN POWERS" DO NOT HALT MILITARY AND FINANCIAL SUPPORT TO THE
VARIOUS FACTIONS FIGHTING IN THE CONVULSED REGION.

   THE COSTA RICAN, NICARAGUAN, GUATEMALAN, SALVADORAN, AND HONDURAN
PRESIDENTS WILL MEET IN SAN JOSE SHORTLY TO FIND A SOLUTION TO THE
SALVADORAN CONFLICT AND REACTIVATE THE ESQUIPULAS II AND TELA
PACIFICATION ACCORDS.

   "IF THE FOREIGN POWERS, BE THEY THE UNITED STATES, CUBA, THE SOVIET
UNION, OR WHATEVER, PERSIST ON DISTURBING A DIRECT ANALYSIS AND
PREVENTING A FRIENDLY AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE CENTRAL AMERICAN
PRESIDENTS, THIS SUMMIT WILL COME TO NOTHING," PEREZ POINTED OUT.

   PEREZ SAID THAT THE RECENT FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION
FRONT [FMLN] OFFENSIVE IN EL SALVADOR INTERFERED SERIOUSLY WITH THE
REGIONAL PACIFICATION PROCESS.  HE REQUESTED THAT THE SALVADORAN
GOVERNMENT CLARIFY THE DEATH OF SIX JESUITS WHO WERE MURDERED BY THE
DEATH SQUADS.

   "THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT THE SALVADORAN CRISIS OCCURRED AT AN
UNTIMELY MOMENT, WHEN THINGS WERE GOING SO WELL.  THE RESPONSIBILITY
FOR THIS, HOWEVER, RESTS HEAVILY WITH THE FMLN AND THOSE WHO GAVE ARMS
TO THE REBELS SO THEY COULD CARRY OUT SO MAJOR A MILITARY OPERATION,"
HE SAID.

   HE ADDED, HOWEVER, THAT "THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT IS ACCOUNTABLE
FOR WHAT HAPPENED TO THE SIX JESUITS, WHO WERE MURDERED IN A LOWLY AND
WICKED MANNER. THIS MUST BE CLARIFIED ALSO," HE SAID.

   THE VENEZUELAN PRESIDENT, WHO OFFERED TO MEDIATE IN THE SALVADORAN
CONFLICT, SAID HE REPORTED TO COSTA RICAN PRESIDENT OSCAR ARIAS, THE
SUMMIT'S HOST, THE CONTENTS OF A LETTER THAT THE FMLN SENT TO PEREZ,
IN WHICH THE ORGANIZATION PROPOSES A CEASE-FIRE WITH INTERNATIONAL
VERIFICATION.

   PEREZ ASKED THE SALVADORAN GUERRILLAS TO BE MORE FLEXIBLE BECAUSE
"THE FATE OF ALL OF LATIN AMERICA IS AT STAKE."

   REFERRING DIRECTLY TO THE SAN JOSE SUMMIT -- HE SAID HE WAS
INSTRUMENTAL IN CHOOSING COSTA RICA AS SITE FOR THE MEETING -- PEREZ
ASSUMED AN "OPTIMISTIC YET CONCERNED" STANCE WITH REGARD TO THE
MEETING'S RESULTS.

   HE FINALLY SAID: "THIS SAN JOSE SUMMIT WILL MAKE THINGS CONFORM TO
ESQUIPULAS II AND TELA IF THE CENTRAL AMERICAN PRESIDENTS ARE LEFT
ALONE AND PARTICULARLY IF THEY KNOW THAT NONE OF THEM WILL BE BACKED
BY ANY ONE POWER WITH ARMS OR MONEY."
