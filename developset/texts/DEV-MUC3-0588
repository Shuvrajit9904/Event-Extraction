DEV-MUC3-0588 (MCDONNELL DOUGLAS)

   CLANDESTINE, 19 OCT 89 -- [TEXT] RUBEN ZAMORA, LEADER OF THE
POPULAR SOCIAL CHRISTIAN MOVEMENT AND THE DEMOCRATIC CONVERGENCE, WAS
UNHARMED FOLLOWING A TERRORIST ATTACK.

   ZAMORA SAID THE COUNTRY IS SUFFERING FROM A WAVE OF VIOLENCE
LAUNCHED BY GROUPS THAT DO NOT WANT THE NEGOTIATIONS TO SUCCEED. HE
ALSO SAID THERE ARE ULTRARIGHTIST GROUPS THAT DO NOT SEEK A NEGOTIATED
SETTLEMENT BECAUSE THEY BELIEVE THEIR INTERESTS WILL BE HARMED, AND
ADDED THAT THERE ARE GROUPS WITHIN THE ARMED FORCES AND ARENA
[NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE] THAT DO NOT WANT THE NEGOTIATIONS.
HE SAID THESE GROUPS TEND TO REACT WITH INCREASED VIOLENCE.
