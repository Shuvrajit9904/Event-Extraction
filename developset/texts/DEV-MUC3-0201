   LIMA, 8 MAY 89 (TELEVISION PERUANA) -- [EXCERPTS] SENATOR LUIS
ALBERTO SANCHEZ HAS BEEN DESIGNATED NEW PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL OF
MINISTERS.  THIS WAS REPORTED BY PRESIDENT ALAN GARCIA ON ARRIVING AT
GOVERNMENT PALACE AFTER PAYING HOMAGE IN CONGRESS TO LATE [APRA
AMERICAN POPULAR REVOLUTIONARY ALLIANCE] DEPUTY PABLO LI ORMENO.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [ALAN GARCIA] I THINK IT IS A BARBAROUS CRIME WHICH WE
MUST REPUDIATE AND AGAINST WHICH WE MUST ALL FIGHT.

   WE NEED TO PUT ALL POLICE FORCES IN THE STRUGGLE AGAINST TERRORISM.  WE
CAN NO LONGER SCATTER OUR EFFORTS AND KEEP SOME SECTORS IDLE.  I HAVE SEEN
POLICE AGENTS WORKING AS DRIVERS, SOME OF THEM PLAYING THE ROLE OF GREAT
PERSONALITIES, OF CHIEFS. I HAVE SEEN MANY POLICEMEN DOING ADMINISTRATIVE
WORK.  WE ARE PAYING THOSE PEOPLE AND WE HAVE TRAINED THEM TO FIGHT AGAINST
OUR MAIN ENEMY, WHICH IS TERRORISM.

   I WANT TO TELL YOU THAT THE PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL OF MINISTERS, AND
WITH HIM ALL MEMBERS OF THE MINISTERIAL CABINET, HAVE PRESENTED THEIR
RESIGNATIONS.  PRIME MINISTER ARMANDO VILLANUEVA FEELS THAT A POLITICAL
RENEWAL IS NECESSARY TO GIVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO THE DEMOCRATIC SECTORS TO
PARTICIPATE MORE ACTIVELY IN THE STRUGGLE AGAINST SUBVERSION.  THE MURDER OF
ANOTHER CONGRESSMAN HAS LED THE MINISTERS TO PRESENT THEIR RESIGNATIONS.

   THIS POLITICAL RENEWAL MUST LEAD ALL PERUVIANS TO JOIN EFFORTS.  WE MUST
FORGET OUR ELECTORAL CONFRONTATIONS AND ADVERSITIES FOR A WHILE AND
UNDERSTAND THAT THE STRUGGLE AGAINST TERRORISM IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE
ELECTIONS.  WE MUST UNDERSTAND THAT WE ARE AT WAR AGAINST TERRORISM, THAT WE
ARE AT WAR AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING, AND THAT THIS WAR REPRESENTS A COST OF
THOUSANDS OF MILLIONS OF INTIS, DOZENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS.  WE MUST MAKE
THIS TREMENDOUS EFFORT TO END SUBVERSION ONCE AND FOR ALL. [END RECORDING]
