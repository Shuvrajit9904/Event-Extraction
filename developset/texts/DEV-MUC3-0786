   SAN SALVADOR, 17 NOV 89 (DOMESTIC SERVICE) -- [STATEMENT]
[SALVADORAN PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI] [TEXT] SALVADORAN PEOPLE: WE
HAVE POWERFUL REASONS FOR ENSURING THAT JUSTICE WILL BE SERVED IN THIS
REGRETTABLE INCIDENT IN WHICH FATHER ELLACURIA, OTHER PRIESTS, AND
CIVILIANS WERE KILLED.  WE WANT TO TELL THOSE WHO ARE TRYING TO DRAW
PREMATURE CONCLUSIONS TO ABSTAIN FROM DOING SO; WE URGE YOU TO HEED
THE COMMUNITY OF JESUS AND THE ARCHBISHOPRIC OF SAN SALVADOR'S CALLS
THAT THIS CASE NOT BE POLITICIZED OR USED TO GENERATE FURTHER VIOLENCE
IN THE COUNTRY.

   WE BELIEVE THAT AN INVESTIGATION MUST BE CONDUCTED; WE ARE
COMMITTED TO CONDUCTING AN IN-DEPTH INVESTIGATION TO PUNISH THE
PERPETRATORS OF THIS SAVAGE ACTION REGARDLESS OF WHO IS INVOLVED.  THE
ARMED FORCES HIGH COMMAND AND THE GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC WILL
REQUEST HELP TO ENSURE THAT THE SALVADORAN CRIME INVESTIGATION
COMMISSION WILL BE ADVISED BY EXPERTS IN ORDER TO GET TO THE ROOT OF
THIS REGRETTABLE INCIDENT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.  WE WILL ASK THE UNITED
STATES, GREAT BRITAIN, AND SPAIN TO HELP US.  I MENTION SPAIN BECAUSE
SOME OF THOSE WHO WERE ASSASSINATED ARE CITIZENS OF THAT COUNTRY.

   SALVADORAN PEOPLE: WE BELIEVE THAT THE TIME HAS COME TO CONDUCT AN
INVESTIGATION AND ENSURE THAT JUSTICE IS SERVED IN REPREHENSIBLE
ACTIONS LIKE THIS ONE INSTEAD OF POLITICIZING THEM AND GENERATING
FURTHER VIOLENCE.

   THE GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC AND THE ARMED FORCES WILL NEVER
ALLOW A RETURN TO THE PAST; A RETURN TO THOSE DRAMATIC AND REGRETTABLE
TIMES IN THE COUNTRY WHEN GROUPS WANTED TO FUTHER THEIR CAUSE THROUGH
VIOLENT ACTS SUCH AS THIS ONE.  WE WILL NOT ALLOW THIS TO HAPPEN AND
WILL PURSUE SUCH GROUPS TO ENSURE THAT THEY FEEL THE FULL FORCE OF THE
LAW.
