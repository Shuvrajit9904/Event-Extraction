DEV-MUC3-1100 (UNISYS)

   CLANDESTINE, 11 FEB 90 (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [COMMUNIQUE]
[FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN)] [TEXT] TODAY, 11
FEBRUARY, AT 0900, THE SALVADORAN AIR FORCE BEGAN BOMBING AND FIRING
ROCKETS AGAINST A SETTLEMENT OF REPATRIATES IN HUANCORA, SAN ISIDRO
LABRADOR JURISDICTION, CHALATENANGO DEPARTMENT, WITH TWO A-37 PLANES
AND FOUR HELICOPTER GUNSHIPS, KILLING SIX PERSONS, WOUNDING THREE
OTHERS, AND DESTROYING SEVERAL HOMES.  IN VIEW OF THESE ACTIONS, THE
FMLN STATES:

   1. WE STRONGLY CONDEMN THIS COWARDLY ATTACK, WHICH WAS CARRIED OUT
PURPOSEFULLY BECAUSE THE PLACE IS COMPLETELY VISIBLE AND IDENTIFIABLE
AS AN AREA POPULATED BY REPATRIATES.

   2. THIS NEW CRIME DESTROYS THE VAUNTED FALSE IMAGE OF
PROFESSIONALISM BY THE SALVADORAN MILITARY AND SHOWS THAT THE
VIOLATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS IS A DAILY PRACTICE IN THE ARMY.

   3. THIS ACTION ALSO SHOWS THE LACK OF WILL ON THE PART OF THE AIR
FORCE TO ACHIEVE A NEGOTIATED SOLUTION [TO THE CONFLICT].  THE
PERSISTENCE OF THESE CRIMES AGAINST DEFENSELESS PEOPLE CONFIRMS THE
NEED FOR US TO REMAIN ARMED AND TO USE OUR MILITARY POWER TO ACHIEVE A
NEGOTIATED SOLUTION AND PROTECT HUMAN RIGHTS.

   WE CALL ON ALL HUMANITARIAN AND RELIGIOUS ORGANIZATIONS TO PRESENT
THEMSELVES AT THE PLACE TO CONFIRM THE OCCURRENCE OF THESE ACTIONS AND
TO DENOUNCE THEM WITH FULL VIGOR.
