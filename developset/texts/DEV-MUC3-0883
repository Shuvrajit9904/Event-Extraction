DAMAGE CAUSED BY A TERRORIST ATTACK AT THE OFFICES OF RADIO MINERIA.

   ERNANI VALDA, THE DIRECTOR OF THE RADIO STATION, HAS REPORTED
THAT SO FAR THE DAMAGE IS ESTIMATED AT 2.5 MILLION PESOS.

   THE BOMB WAS PLACED IN THE OFFICE OF POLITICAL COMMENTATOR GERMAN

THE OFFICES WHEN THE EXPLOSION OCCURRED; ONE OF THEM WAS INJURED.

   WE SPOKE WITH REPORTER HERMOGENES CARRILLO, WHO ARRIVED AT THE

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [CARRILLO] ONE PERSON SUFFERED MINOR INJURIES AND
THE OFFICES OF RADIO MINERIA WERE SUBSTANTIALLY DAMAGED DURING THE
BOMB ATTACK HERE AT THE INTERSECTION OF PROVIDENCIA AND TOBALABA
STREETS THIS MORNING AT 0510. [PASSAGE OMITTED]

   THE RADIO STATION WAS OFF THE AIR FOR 45 MINUTES, DURING WHICH TIME
CARABINEROS PERSONNEL INSPECTED THE SITE TO CONFIRM THAT THERE WERE NO
OTHER BOMBS.

   GOPE [SPECIAL OPERATIONS GROUP] PERSONNEL ARRIVED LATER.
ACCORDING TO THEIR SPECIALIZED PERSONNEL THE BOMB CONTAINED TRONEX
[EXPANSION UNKNOWN], AND IT HAD BEEN PLACED BY ONE OF THE WINDOWS ON
PROVIDENCIA STREET.

   AT LEAST TWO OR THREE PEOPLE WERE INVOLVED IN THE ATTACK.  THEY
SOMEHOW CLIMBED TO THE SECOND FLOOR, PLACED THE BOMB, LIT THE FUSE,
AND FLED.

   NO WARNING WAS RECEIVED NOR HAS ANY SUBVERSIVE MOVEMENT CLAIMED
RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS ATTACK SO FAR.

   WE HAVE RECEIVED TELEPHONE CALLS FROM OUR LISTENERS ACROSS THE
COUNTRY.  WE HAVE ALSO RECEIVED IMPORTANT POLITICAL PERSONALITIES,
INCLUDING PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE HERNAN BUCHI AND INTERIOR MINISTER
CARLOS CACERES.

   AMONG OTHERS, WE HAVE RECEIVED A CALL FROM OSORNO FROM
[PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE] FRANCISCO JAVIER ERRAZURIZ AND
ANOTHER CALL FROM SANTIAGO FROM RICARDO LAGOS.

   THIS IS ALL WE CAN REPORT FOR NOW.  THE COST HAS NOT YET BEEN
ESTIMATED, BUT IT WILL BE SUBSTANTIAL.

   THIS WAS A REPORT BY RADIO MINERIA FOR RADIO NACIONAL DE CHILE.
