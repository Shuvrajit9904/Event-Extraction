   LIMA, 17 APR 89 (TELAM-EFE) -- [TEXT] THE POLICE HAVE ARRESTED JOSE
LUIS FRANCISCO GUTIERREZ, A COLOMBIAN CITIZEN, 28, WHO IS SUSPECTED OF
BEING A MEMBER OF THE COLOMBIAN M-19 GUERRILLA GROUP.

   GUTIERREZ WAS ARRESTED YESTERDAY WHILE TRAVELLING IN A CAR WITH PERUVIAN
ENGINEER MIGUEL RINCON RINCON IN WHOSE POSSESSION THE POLICE FOUND
SUBVERSIVE PROPAGANDA FROM THE OUTLAWED REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT TUPAC AMARU
(MRTA) OF PERU.  

   POLICE INTELLIGENCE SOURCES AFFIRMED HAVE CONFIRMED THE ARREST OF THIS
COLOMBIAN CITIZEN AND SAID THAT IT IS VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE HE MAY BE THE
LIASON BETWEEN THE M-19 AND THE MRTA.  TWO YEARS AGO, THESE GROUPS CREATED
THE NOW DISMANTLED "AMERICA BATTALLION," WHICH STATED SOME ARMED OPERATION
IN COLOMBIAN TERRITORY.  

   THE ARREST OF JOSE LUIS FRANCISCO GUTIERREZ BRINGS TO THREE THE NUMBER OF
COLOMBIANS THAT HAVE BEEN SEIZED AND THAT ARE UNDER INVESTIGATION BY THE
ANTITERRORIST POLICE (DIRCOTE).  HENRY VLADIMIR DELGADO SALAZAR AND JOSE
ALZATE CARDONA WERE ARRESTED FOLLOWING THE ARMED ATTACK ON THE POLICE POST
AT UCHIZA, IN THE PERUVIAN NORTHEAST, WHERE 10 POLICEMEN WERE KILLED.
