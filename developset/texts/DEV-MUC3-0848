   SAN JOSE (COSTA RICA), 22 NOV 89 (RADIO IMPACTO) -- [TEXT] A COLOMBIAN
CITIZEN WAS CAPTURED BY THE U.S. SECRET SERVICE IN PANAMA AFTER HE PLACED A
BOMB IN A MOVIE THEATER AT ONE OF THE U.S. SOUTHERN COMMAND'S MILITARY
BASES.

   APPARENTLY, THE BOMB WAS SUPPOSED TO HAVE GONE OFF WHEN THE MOVIE
THEATER WAS SHOWING ONE OF ITS DAILY MOVIES AT NIGHT.

   ACCORDING TO [RADIO] IMPACTO SOURCES, THE INDIVIDUAL CONFESSED THAT
THE [DIGNITY] BATTALIONS, HEADED BY [BENJAMIN] COLAMARCO AND FOLLOWING
NORIEGA'S ORDERS, ARE READY TO BEGIN A CAMPAIGN OF TERROR AT U.S.
BASES.

   OVER THE PAST FEW DAYS, THE U.S.  SOUTHERN COMMAND HAS REPORTED
SEVERAL BOMB THREATS AT ITS MILITARY INSTALLATIONS, AND, FOR THIS
REASON, SECURITY AT THE BASES HAS INCREASED.
