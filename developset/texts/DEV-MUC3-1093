   SAN SALVADOR, 7 FEB 90 (AFP) -- [TEXT] COLONEL RENE EMILIO PONCE,
CHIEF OF THE ARMED FORCES JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF, CATEGORICALLY DENIED
TODAY THAT THERE ARE ANY RIFTS BETWEEN SALVADORAN ARMY OFFICERS AND
U.S. MILITARY ADVISERS, AS ASSERTED THIS WEEK BY THE U.S. MEDIA.

   "I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT THIS.  OUR RELATIONS WITH THE NORTH AMERICANS
ARE NORMAL AS USUAL," PONCE SAID TO JOURNALISTS, ADDING, "THE U.S.
ADVISERS HAVE HELPED US VERY MUCH IN THE PROFESSIONALIZATION OF THE
ARMED FORCES, AND THEY CONTINUE TO WORK WITH US."

   THE MILITARY OFFICER STATED: "THERE ARE ALWAYS THOSE WHO TRY TO
FORCE OR BREAK THE STRATEGIC ALLIANCE BETWEEN THE SALVADORAN
GOVERNMENT AND ARMED FORCES AND THE UNITED STATES."

   REPORTS FROM THE U.S. CONGRESS SAID THAT THE ARREST OF EIGHT ARMY
MEMBERS LINKED WITH THE ASSASSINATION OF SIX JESUIT PRIESTS AND TWO
WOMEN ON 16 NOVEMBER HAS PROVOKED SERIOUS DISPUTES BETWEEN SOME
MILITARY COMMANDERS AND THE U.S. ADVISER CORPS DETACHED TO THE
COUNTRY.

   PONCE PARTICIPATED ON WEDNESDAY, 7 FEBRUARY, IN THE CEREMONY TO
TURN OVER COMMAND OF THE MILITARY SCHOOL TO COLONEL RICARDO CASANOVA,
REPLACING COLONEL GUILLERMO BENAVIDES, ONE OF THE MEN INVOLVED IN THE
ASSASSINATION OF THE JESUITS.

   PONCE REPORTED THAT THE MILITARY OFFICERS ACCUSED OF THE CRIME ARE
IMPRISONED AT THE NATIONAL POLICE GENERAL HEADQUARTERS, BUT THEY ARE
STILL IN ACTIVE SERVICE AND ARE RECEIVING A SALARY WHILE THE COURTS
ISSUE A RULING ON THIS CASE.
