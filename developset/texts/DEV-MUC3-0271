   SAN SALVADOR, 30 JUN 89 (CANAL SEIS TELEVISION) -- [TEXT]
SALVADORAN PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI HAS BLAMED FMLN [FARABUNDO
MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT] GUERRILLAS FOR THE MURDER OF
POLITICAL ANALYST EDGAR CHACON AND HAS STRESSED THAT, DESPITE THESE
ACTIONS, HE IS UNDETERRED FROM HIS INTENTION TO SIT DOWN AND TALK WITH
THE REBELS TO PUT AN END TO THE CONFLICT.

   PRESIDENT CRISTIANI SAID THAT HIS GOVERNMENT WOULD NOT BE BLACKMAILED BY
THE WAVE OF VIOLENCE UNLEASHED BY THE FMLN.  THE PRESIDENT SAID THAT THESE
ACTIONS ONLY SERVE TO CONFIRM THE WEAKNESS OF THE FMLN, WHICH SEEKS POWER
THROUGH VIOLENCE.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [CRISTIANI] THE FMLN'S POWERLESSNESS AND INABILITY TO DO
BATTLE USING IDEAS RATHER THAN VIOLENCE BECAME EVIDENT AGAIN TODAY.  THE
FMLN HAS AGAIN TRIED TO SILENCE THE VOICE OF ANOTHER SALVADORAN WHO FOUGHT
WITH WORDS AND THOUGHTS.  IN EVERY SENSE, THIS HAS BEEN A COWARDLY ACT AND
IT CAN ONLY BE DESCRIBED AS THAT.  IT IS THE WORK OF SICK MINDS.  I BELIEVE
THAT THIS IS WHAT THE FMLN HAS PROVEN TO BE -- A GROUP OF SICK PEOPLE WHO DO
NOT UNDERSTAND THE CLAMOR OF A PEOPLE WHO WISH TO TALK RATHER THAN USE
VIOLENCE, A PEOPLE WHO WANT PEACE IN EL SALVADOR.  

   WE ARE ON THE SIDE OF THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE, AND THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE
WANT US TO DO WHAT WE CAN TO ACHIEVE PEACE IN EL SALVADOR.  BECAUSE WE WISH
TO DO WHAT THE PEOPLE WANT, WE WILL ALWAYS HAVE THE DOORS OPEN IN THE HOPE
OF ACHIEVING PEACE IN OUR HOMELAND. [END RECORDING]
