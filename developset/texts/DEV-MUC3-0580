   SAN SALVADOR, 17 OCT 89 (RADIO CADENA YSU) -- [COMMUNIQUE]
[SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT] [TEXT] THE GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF EL
SALVADOR STRONGLY CONDEMNS THE BASE AND COWARDLY MURDER OF MS DOLORES
ISABEL CASANOVA PORRAS, CARRIED OUT THIS MORNING BY FMLN [FARABUNDO
MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT] TERRORISTS IN SANTA TECLA AS THE
INNOCENT VICTIM WAS ON HER WAY TO HER SPORTS EXERCISES.  THIS CRIME,
VICIOUSLY AND COLDLY CARRIED OUT BY THE FMLN, CLEARLY SHOWS THE WORLD
THE FMLN IS AN ORGANIZATION LED AND MADE UP BY INDIVIDUALS FOR WHOM
HUMAN LIFE MEANS NOTHING.

   THIS DESPICABLE CRIME PERPETRATED AGAINST MS CASONOVA PORRAS
CONFIRMS THE FMLN IS IMPLEMENTING A DEATH-LIKE TERRORIST PLAN THAT
INCLUDES THE MURDER OF PUBLIC OFFICIALS AND THEIR RELATIVES, AS THE
PRESIDENT PUBLICLY CHARGED ON 14 OCTOBER.  CONDEMNING THIS NEW CRIME
BY FMLN URBAN CELLS, THE GOVERNMENT ASKS: HOW CAN FMLN LEADERS IN
COSTA RICA TALK OF PEACE AND RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS WHEN DEFENSELESS
PERSONS ARE BEING RUTHLESSLY AND IRRATIONALLY MURDERED ON ORDERS FROM
THE FMLN?

   THE GOVERNMENT HEREBY CONVEYS ITS DEEP CONDOLENCES AND SOLIDARITY
TO MS CASANOVA PORRAS' FAMILY OVER THIS IRREPARABLE LOSS. MOREOVER, IT
ASKS THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY OF NATIONS AND HUMAN RIGHTS
RAPPORTEUR PROFESSOR PASTOR RIDREJO TO TAKE DUE NOTICE OF THIS
DESPICABLE HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATION CARRIED OUT BY THE FMLN AT A TIME
WHEN THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT DELEGATION IS ENGAGED IN A DIALOGUE IN
GOOD FAITH AND WITH THE BEST POLITICAL INTENTIONS TO REACH PEACE,
SOMETHING THE SALVADORAN PEOPLE YEARN FOR.

   THE GOVERNMENT HOLDS THE FMLN RESPONSIBLE FOR JEOPARDIZING THE
DIALOGUE PROCESS TO REACH PEACE, AND HOPES THAT THE FMLN ADOPTS A
RESPONSIBLE STAND AND THAT ITS PEACEFUL WORDS ARE MATCHED BY DEEDS.
