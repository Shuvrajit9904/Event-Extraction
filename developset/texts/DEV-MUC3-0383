NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE CENTER, CNI, REPORTED THIS AFTERNOON THAT
ROBERTO NORDENFLYGHT FARIAS, WHO KILLED ARMY LIEUTENANT ROBERTO ZEGERS
REED IN AN ARMED CLASH IN SANTIAGO LAST SUNDAY, WAS AT THE TIME OF HIS
DEATH DEPUTY CHIEF OF THE MANUEL RODRIGUEZ PATRIOTIC FRONT [FPMR] AND
THE STEPSON OF COMMUNIST LEADER VOLODIA TEITELBOIM.

   IN OFFICIAL COMMUNIQUE, THE CNI PUBLIC RELATIONS OFFICE SAYS THAT A
REVIEW OF THE DOCUMENTS SEIZED FROM NORDENFLYGHT'S HOME MADE IT POSSIBLE FOR
THE CNI TO CONCLUDE THAT HE WAS THE DEPUTY CHIEF OF THE FPMR, THE ARMED
BRANCH OF THE CHILEAN COMMUNIST PARTY [PCCH] 

   NORDENFLYGHT, WHO WAS KILLED BY A SENTRY IN THE ARMED CLASH AT THE
TOBALABA AIR FIELD AFTER KILLING LT ZEGERS, ASSUMED THE LEADERSHIP POSITION
WITHIN THE EXTREMIST ORGANIZATION IN SEPTEMBER 1988, THE CNI SAID.

   IN THIS CAPACITY, NORDEFLYGHT SUPERVISED A 21 OCTOBER ATTACK ON A POLICE
DETACHMENT AND RESIDENTS OF THE MOUNTAIN TOWNSHIP OF LOS QUENES, IN THE
SEVENTH REGION.

   THE CNI ADDS THAT NORDENFLYGHT WAS THE SON OF ELIANA DEL CARMEN FARIAS
ASSIF, WHO HAS BEEN MARRIED TO PCCH GENERAL SECRETARY VOLODIA TEITELBOIM
SINCE JANUARY 1986.
