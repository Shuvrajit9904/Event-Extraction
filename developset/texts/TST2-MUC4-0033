   SAN SALVADOR, 28 NOV 89 (DOMESTIC SERVICE) -- [TEXT] FRANCISCO
MERINO, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC AND INTERIOR MINISTER, HAS
STRONGLY CONDEMNED THE MURDER OF FORMER SUPREME COURT PRESIDENT
FRANCISCO JOSE GUERRERO.  MERINO DESCRIBED THE CULPRITS AS MURDEROUS
BEASTS.

   THE VICE PRESIDENT WENT TO THE MEDICAL-SURGICAL HOSPITAL OF THE
SALVADORAN INSTITUTE OF SOCIAL SECURITY, TO WHICH DR GUERRERO WAS
TAKEN AFTER THE ATTACK.  GUERRERO, WHO WAS AN ADVISER TO THE
GOVERNMENTAL COMMISSION FOR SUPPORT TO THE DIALOGUE [COMISION DE APOYO
GUBERNAMENTAL DE DIALOGO], WAS SHOT TO DEATH BY TERRORISTS AT THE
INTERSECTION OF BOULEVARD DE LOS HEROES AND ALAMEDA JUAN PABLO II.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [MERINO] WHAT THEY ARE SHOWING IS THAT THEY ARE
BENT ON CARRYING OUT TOTALLY DESTRUCTIVE ACTIONS TO LOWER THE
CONFIDENCE OF THE POPULATION AND TO PROVOKE GENERAL PANIC.  I THINK
THAT ALTHOUGH AS A GOVERNMENT WE HAVE ALWAYS MAINTAINED A CONCILIATORY
POSITION TO ATTAIN PEACE IN EL SALVADOR, WE MUST ALSO MAKE A FIRMER
DECISION TO TAKE STRONGER ACTION.  THE PEOPLE WHO COMMIT THESE WANTON
ACTIONS ARE DERANGED PEOPLE.  THEY DO NOT UNDERSTAND WORDS.  THEY DO
NOT UNDERSTAND THAT THEY MUST RESPECT A LEGAL SYSTEM, OR A DEMOCRATIC
PROCESS OR ONE OF HUMANIZATION.  THEY ARE SIMPLY BEASTS AND MURDERERS
AND MUST BE TREATED AS SUCH.  [END RECORDING]

   MERINO SAID THE MURDERERS MUST BE PUNISHED WITH THE FULL WEIGHT OF
THE LAWS, AND THAT ONE OF THE TERRORISTS WHO WAS WOUNDED AND CAPTURED
AT THE SITE OF THE CRIME IS UNDER INTERROGATION.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [MERINO] ONE OF THE CRIMINALS WAS WOUNDED.  THIS
WILL OBVIOUSLY ENABLE US TO OBTAIN SOME CLUES AS TO THE IDENTITY OF
THE ACTUAL KILLERS AND OF THE MASTERMINDS OF THIS NEW MURDER, WHICH
HAS SHOCKED SALVADORAN SOCIETY.

   AS IN PREVIOUS CASES, WE ARE CONDUCTING INVESTIGATIONS IN THIS
CASE.  HOWEVER, I REPEAT THAT THE TIME HAS COME FOR US TO TAKE A
FIRMER STAND, TO DO OUR UTMOST, AND TO REALIZE THAT IF NOTHING HAS
HAPPENED TO US THUS FAR, IT DOES NOT MEAN WE WILL NOT FALL VICTIM TO
THESE MURDERERS.  IT IS BETTER TO TAKE PRECAUTIONS NOW THAN TO HAVE
REGRETS LATER.  [END RECORDING]

   MERINO SAID THAT THIS CAMPAIGN OF VIOLENCE PROMOTED BY THE
TERRORIST HORDES HAS NOT ENDED.  CLEAR EVIDENCE OF THIS IS THIS BRUTAL
AND COWARDLY MURDER, WHICH HAS AGAIN FILLED THE SUFFERING SALVADORAN
PEOPLE WITH SORROW.
