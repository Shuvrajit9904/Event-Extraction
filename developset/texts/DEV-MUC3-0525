   NO CITY (COLOMBIA), 27 SEP 89 -- [TEXT] [BARCO] SOME OF THE
ARRESTED PERSONS ARE EXTRADITABLE.  THE PEOPLE HAVE RISEN UP AGAINST
TERRORISM, AND THE TERRORISTS CANNOT HIDE FOREVER.

   THIRD, MUCH INTERNATIONAL SUPPORT FOR COLOMBIA, ITS DEMOCRACY, ITS
PEOPLE, AND ITS GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN MOBILIZED.  COLOMBIA IS NO LONGER
SEEN AS A COUNTRY OF DRUG TRAFFICKERS, SOMETHING IT HAS NEVER BEEN AND
NEVER WILL BE.

   NOW EVERYONE UNDERSTANDS THAT WE ARE A COUNTRY OF BRAVE PEOPLE
WHERE THE MAJORITY ARE HONEST AND HARD-WORKING.  THE WORLD HAS
ACKNOWLEDGED AND PRAISED DEMOCRACY IN COLOMBIA, THE VICTIM OF A
PROBLEM IT HAS NOT CREATED.

   FOURTH, INVESTIGATIONS INTO THE CRIMES COMMITTED BY NARCOTERRORISTS
CONTINUE GIVING POSITIVE RESULTS.  MORE THAN 25 BANDS OF ASSASSINS
HAVE BEEN DISMANTLED, AND THEIR MEMBERS HAVE BEEN DISPERSED.  TWO OF
THE PEOPLE WHO PARTICIPATED IN THE ASSASSINATION OF LUIS CARLOS GALAN
HAVE CONFESSED TO THE CRIME.  THE DEPARTMENT OF ADMINISTRATIVE
SECURITY HAS IDENTIFIED 110 PERSONS WHO FORM PART OF A NARCOTERRORIST
NETWORK.  THE MOST IMPORTANT ASSASSINATIONS HAVE BEEN CLEARED UP.

   FIFTH, THE AUTHORITIES HAVE BEEN ABLE TO CHECK THE TERRORISTS'
COUNTEROFFENSIVE, ALTHOUGH IT CANNOT BE DENIED THAT THE CRIMINALS ARE
STILL CAPABLE OF CAUSING MUCH DAMAGE.  THIS HAS BEEN MADE EVIDENT BY
THE EXPLOSIVES THEY HAVE PLACED, THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE DIED AND WHO HAVE
BEEN INJURED, AND THE FIRES THEY HAVE PRODUCED.

   THE AUTHORITIES HAVE BEEN ABLE TO FRUSTRATE MANY ATTACKS.
CRIMINALS WHO HAVE CARRIED OUT ATTACKS HAVE BEEN CAPTURED.  FOR
EXAMPLE, IN MEDELLIN, 35 CRIMINALS WHO WERE COORDINATING WITH THE
TERRORIST NATIONAL LIBERATION ARMY HAVE BEEN CAPTURED.

   SIXTH, DRUG TRAFFICKING CAPABILITIES HAVE DECREASED.  NOW THERE IS
MUCH LESS COCAINE IN THE UNITED STATES AND IN OTHER WORLD MARKETS. IT
IS IMPORTANT TO EMPHASIZE THE FACT THAT IT IS UP TO THE UNITED STATES
AND THE EUROPEAN COUNTRIES TO INCREASE THEIR ACTIVITIES TO DIMINISH
AND CONTROL DRUG CONSUMPTION.  IF THERE WERE NO ADDICTS IN THOSE
COUNTRIES, THERE WOULD BE NO DRUG TRAFFICKING.

   THIS IS NOT THE ONLY RESPONSIBILITY OF THE OTHER COUNTRIES INVOLVED
IN THE WAR AGAINST DRUG TRAFFICKING.  IF DRUG TRAFFICKERS WERE UNABLE
TO USE THEIR MONEY THROUGH INTERNATIONAL BANKS AND INVESTMENT
OPPORTUNITIES THAT OTHER COUNTRIES OFFER, THE INCENTIVES FOR THE
BUSINESS WOULD VANISH.

   IF THE CHEMICAL PRODUCTS THAT ARE NECESSARY TO PROCESS COCAINE DID
NOT ARRIVE IN OUR COUNTRY FROM EUROPE AND THE UNITED STATES, THE DRUG
COULD NOT BE PRODUCED.

   IF THE INTERNATIONAL ARMS MARKET WERE UNDER CONTROL, THE TERRORISTS
WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GET THE ARMS THEY HAVE USED TO SPILL SO
MUCH BLOOD IN COLOMBIA.  [CONTINUED]
