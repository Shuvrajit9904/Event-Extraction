DEV-MUC3-1207 (SYNCHRONETICS)

   SAN SALVADOR, 3 APR 90 (RADIO CADENA YSKL) -- [NEWS CONFERENCE WITH
COLONEL RENE EMILIO PONCE, CHAIRMAN OF THE ARMED FORCES JOINT CHIEFS
OF STAFF, BY UNIDENTIFIED REPORTERS] [EXCERPTS] [REPORTER] WHAT IS THE
POSITION OF THE ARMED FORCES CONCERNING THE PRESIDENTIAL SUMMIT IN
NICARAGUA AND THE UPCOMING DIALOGUE TO BE HELD IN GENEVA BETWEEN THE
REBELS AND THE GOVERNMENT?  WILL THE ARMED FORCES SEEK SUPPORT FOR THE
DIALOGUE AND A SOLUTION TO THE CONFLICT?

   [PONCE] LAST WEEK THE ARMED FORCES RELEASED A PUBLIC MESSAGE TO THE
PEOPLE EXPLAINING THEIR STAND AND MENTIONING THREE BASIC POINTS:

   FIRST, THE ARMED FORCES SUPPORT A DIALOGUE THAT SEEKS PEACE IN THE
COUNTRY THROUGH MECHANISMS OF UNDERSTANDING AND AGREEMENT.

   SECOND, THE ARMED FORCES EXPRESS THEIR LOYALTY TO THE PRESIDENT OF
THE REPUBLIC IN THESE EFFORTS AND OTHER EFFORTS HE MAY UNDERTAKE TO
FIND THE PEACE WE ALL CHERISH IN THIS COUNTRY.

   THIRD, WE POSSESS THE MORAL CONVICTION AND THE OBEDIENCE -- AS
ORDERED BY THE CONSTITUTION -- AS WELL AS THE HUMANISTIC AWARENESS TO
PROMOTE AND PROTECT THE HUMAN RIGHTS OF ALL SALVADORANS.

   THOSE ARE THE BASIC POINTS INCLUDED IN OUR MESSAGE TO THE
SALVADORAN PEOPLE THAT WE ANNOUNCED LAST WEEK.

   AS FOR THE PRESIDENTIAL SUMMIT BEING HELD IN NICARAGUA, THE ARMED
FORCES WHOLEHEARTEDLY SUPPORT THE EFFORTS UNDERTAKEN BY OUR GOVERNMENT
TO FIND THE MECHANISMS THAT WILL LEAD US TO PEACE IN THE REGION.  THAT
IS WHY THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC HAS OUR FULL SUPPORT IN THIS
ENDEAVOUR FOR FINDING PEACE AND DEMOCRACY THROUGHOUT CENTRAL AMERICA.

   CONCERNING THE DIALOGUE IN GENEVA, I BELIEVE THAT TOMORROW THERE
WILL BE A BRIEFING WITH THE PARTICIPATION OF DELEGATES FROM THE
GOVERNMENT AND THE FMLN [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT]
TOGETHER WITH THE UN SECRETARY GENERAL, WHO WILL ANNOUNCE THE
MECHANISMS TO BE FOLLOWED IN THIS DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT AND
THE FMLN.

   [REPORTER] WHAT DO THE ARMED FORCES THINK ABOUT THE EIGHT BOMBS
THAT WERE DETONATED YESTERDAY AND KILLED SIX SOLDIERS AND ONE
CIVILIAN?  WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THIS NOW, SINCE IT IS EVIDENT THAT
EXPLOSIVES ARE AGAIN BEING USED AGAINST THE PEOPLE?

   [PONCE] WE, THE ARMED FORCES, FEEL THAT THESE EVENTS ARE CARRIED
OUT BY THE TERRORISTS WITHIN THE FMLN WHO DO NOT BELIEVE DIALOGUE IS A
MECHANISM FOR ACHIEIVING PEACE IN OUR COUNTRY.  THESE INDIVIDUALS
BELIEVE THAT VIOLENCE IS WHAT WILL LEAD THEM TO POWER.  [CONTINUED]
