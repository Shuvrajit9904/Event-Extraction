   SAN JOSE (COSTA RICA), 3 NOV 89 (ACAN-EFE) -- [TEXT] VENEZUELAN
PRESIDENT CARLOS ANDRES PEREZ AND COSTA RICAN PRESIDENT OSCAR ARIAS
ARE WORKING HARD SO THAT THE BREAK IN THE TALKS BETWEEN THE GUERILLAS
AND THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT WILL BE ONLY TEMPORARY.

   ARIAS TODAY IN SAN JOSE ANNOUNCED THAT ON 6 NOVEMBER HE WILL MEET
IN SAN JOSE WITH REPRESENTATIVES OF THE SALVADORAN REBELS, ADDING THAT
HE HAD TALKED WITH PRESIDENT PEREZ REGARDING THE NEED TO "CALL ON THE
PARTIES INVOLVED TO MAINTAIN THEIR WILLINGNESS TO TALK."

   THE COSTA RICAN PRESIDENT, WHO DID NOT DISCLOSE THE TIME AND PLACE
OF HIS MEETING WITH THE REBELS,, SAID THAT HIS GOAL IS TO "URGE THEM
TO PROMISE THAT THE SUSPENSION OF THE DIALOGUE WILL ONLY BE
TEMPORARY."

   ARIAS, 1987 NOBEL PEACE PRIZE WINNER FOR HIS PEACEMAKING EFFORTS IN
CENTRAL AMERICA, ADMITTED, HOWEVER, THAT "PERHAPS THIS IS NOT THE BEST
TIME FOR THE TALKS BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT AND THE FARABUNDO MARTI
NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT (FMLN) TO BE RESUMED."

   IN THE PAST 8 DAYS IN EL SALVADOR, THERE HAVE BEEN SEVERAL ATTACKS
ON MILITARY INSTALLATIONS AND LABOR UNION HEADQUARTERS, DURING WHICH
10 PERSONS WERE KILLED AND MANY INJURED.

   THE SALVADORAN GUERRILLAS DECIDED TO SUSPEND THE TALKS WITH THE
GOVERNMENT -- THE FIRST ROUND OF TALKS HELD IN MEXICO CITY IN
SEPTEMBER AND THE SECOND ROUND IN SAN JOSE, COSTA RICA, IN OCTOBER --
FOLLOWING THE 31 OCTOBER ATTACK ON A LABOR UNION HEADQUARTERS IN SAN
SALVADOR THAT RESULTED IN THE DEATHS OF 10 LABOR LEADERS.

   "I VIEW THIS INTERRUPTION OF THE DIALOGUE WITH GREAT SADDNESS AND
REGRET; HOWEVER, I BELIEVE THAT THIS IS ONLY A STUMBLING BLOCK IN A
PEACE PROCESS THAT IS NOT A VERY EASY ONE," THE COSTA RICAN PRESIDENT
SAID.

   PRESIDENT ARIAS SAID THAT HE HAD ASKED HIS VENEZUELAN COLLEAGUE --
WHO WAS TO HAVE HOSTED THE NEXT ROUND OF TALKS BETWEEN THE SALVADORAN
GOVERNMENT AND THE FMLN -- TO JOIN IN HIS EFFORTS TO URGE THE PARTIES
INVOLVED TO MAINTAIN THEIR WILLINGNESS TO TALK "WHEN THE SITUATION
IMPROVES."

   "ON THE PATH FOR PEACE THERE WILL BE TIMES WHEN STEPS BACKWARDS ARE
TAKEN -- LIKE THE ONE CURRENTLY BEING TAKEN IN EL SALVADOR AND
PREVIOUSLY IN NICARAGUA," PRESIDENT ARIAS SAID IN ALLUSION TO THE
DECISION MADE BY NICARAGUAN PRESIDENT DANIEL ORTEGA'S GOVERNMENT NOT
TO EXTEND THE CEASE-FIRE WITH THE CONTRAS.
