   SAN SALVADOR, 26 MAY 90 (EL DIARIO DE HOY) -- [TEXT] TO DATE, THE
ARMY HAS NO KNOWLEDGE OF A REPORT THAT THE GUATEMALAN GOVERNMENT HAS
SAID IT SENT TO PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI ON THE INVESTIGATIONS
CARRIED OUT IN THAT COUNTRY CONCERNING THE DEATH OF SALVADORAN LEFTIST
LEADER HECTOR OQUELI COLINDRES.

   OQUELI, LEADER OF THE NATIONAL REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT (MNR) AND
HILDA FLORES, A GUATEMALAN SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC LEADER WERE ABDUCTED AND
KILLED IN JANUARY BY UNIDENTIFIED INDIVIDUALS IN GUATEMALA CITY AS
THEY WERE HEADING TO THE LA AURORA AIRPORT.

   PRESIDENT CEREZO WAS IN CARACAS ON THE OCCASION OF THE MEETING
BETWEEN THE FMLN-FDR [FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT -
REVOLUTIONARY DEMOCRATIC FRONT] AND A DELEGATION OF THE SALVADORAN
GOVERNMENT.  ON THAT OCCASION PRESIDENT CEREZO MET WITH BOTH
DELEGATIONS SEPARATELY.  HE INFORMED THEM ABOUT THE INVESTIGATIONS
BEING CONDUCTED CONCERNING THE CRIME AND TOLD THEM THAT HE WOULD SEND
HIS GOVERNMENT'S VERSION TO PRESIDENT CRISTIANI.

   SINCE PRESIDENT CEREZO TOLD JOURNALISTS THAT "SALVADORAN RIGHTIST
SECTORS AND SOLDIERS" COULD BE IMPLICATED IN THE CRIME, YESTERDAY ARMY
SPOKESMEN WERE ASKED TO COMMENT ON THE SUBJECT.  THEY SAID THAT
ALTHOUGH THEY HAVE HEARD SOMETHING TO THAT EFFECT, THEY HAVE NO
SPECIFIC KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE REPORT, WHICH THEY EXPECT TO SEE SOON, IF
IT IS NOT JUST SPECULATION.
